Use join to save time for concatenating (combining) a list of str values. #Example color_list = ['red','blue'] print('$'.join(color_list)) Using the help() function to print all the properties of a given class or method. #Example #Print help for the str method on the python console help(str) To check builtin-in modules loaded use the dunder method and output the properties. Loop through __builtins__.__dict__ and review modules for additional info. #Example for x in __builtins__.__dict__: print(x) or with comprehension #Example [print(x) for x in __builtins__.__dict__] Practice using python comprehension to simplify code. . Use a package manager for python to orchestrate module installation, I perfer poetry. This auto install dependicies for the code to work outside of the system global Having a good understanding of the fundamental topics such as methods, class, and functions will significantly increase your ability to develop/brainstorm solutions for the attended problem. #Example #Using open(), str(), list() methods to modify a given csv file. with open('file.csv',) as csvfile: content = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',') for row in content: for color in row: print(color) Basic Knowledege When creating a variable, it must start as a letter or an underscore Python treats characters differently depending on the class, i.e. ‘1’ is not 1 When in doubt reference Python documentationManipluating the string = strAny string / str can be modified, there are many str.methods at your disposal to transform the characters to your need.String SplicingEssentially selecting a character by picking it’s positional place in the word. Remember positional value starts from 0 and empty value (i.e. blank space) counts.#Exampleword = 'Hello World!'print(word[0])print(word[1])print(word[11])String Splicing IIYou can also iterate over strings with a verbose method [a:b:c] a is the starting position b is the ending position c is the frequencyNote: When using this method positional value start at 1. Default starting value is 0, and frequency value is 1, [0::1] To print in reverse order use the frequency value at -1, [::-1]#Exampleword = 'Hello World!'print(word[1:5:])print(word[::2])print(word[::-1])String AlignmentYou can align string depending on the position of a give text value with the str:&lt;value#Examplemy_string = '{string1:&gt;1}'my_string2 = '{string1:&gt;10}'print(my_string.format(string1='Hello'))print(my_string2.format(string1='Hello'))ExceptionsAre used to handled data that does not mesh with your code. Example, you want a user to enter a data in string format, you can use the Exception class dervived from the BaseException to throw and error." }, { "title": "Building a Cyber Range Lab", "url": "/posts/building-a-cyber-range-lab/", "categories": "tutorials, cyber-range", "tags": "labs", "date": "2022-04-10 06:10:00 +0000", "snippet": "Why Build?For any inspiring professional wanting to break into the tech field, you have to learn and perform your craft quickly.I’ve experinced over time the fastest way to learn is to get straight into the hands-on portion and combine the learning experience with visual aids like reading documentation and watching videos.Environments Compute Node Software based Hypervisor (a.k.a Virtualization software) Operating Systems in ISO format1. Install Virtualization SoftwareI recommend using VMware Player as the virtualization software. It has a simple user interface, and the free version provides all the required tools to get started. Download VMware Player directly from VMware’s Website2. Download the Operating SystemThere are multiple ways to download an operating systems. For Microsoft, navigate to their evaluation website. For Linux systems, navigate to CentOS (RedHat distribution) or Ubuntu (Debian distribution) website.3. Deploy the Virtual MachineOnce the operating system is downloaded, deploy the virtual machine using the recommended system requirements." } ]
